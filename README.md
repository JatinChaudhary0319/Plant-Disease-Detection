<h1 align="center">Plant Disease Detection</h1> 

## About Project:
A Plant disease detection model using Deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network for classifying Leaf images into over 35 categories.<br>The Convolutional Neural Code build in Pytorch Framework. <br>For Training we are using Plant village dataset. 

## For running on your device
1. Download project from github.
2. You must have python install in your machine.
3. Extract files and select folder in editor
4. Install all the dependencies namely pandas, matplotlib, torch, torchvision and torchsummary.
5. Train the model using dataset from [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1).
7. Or download the pre-trained model file `plant_disease_model_1_latest.pt` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Juh1B_5vCttqfuE7vVSrmrZrIxwqg9HP/view?usp=drive_link).
8. Use Test images for testing the model.
